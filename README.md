# üå¶Ô∏è Weather Forecasting MLOps System

This project is an end-to-end MLOps pipeline designed to forecast hourly **temperature** and **humidity** in Hyderabad using real-time weather data. The system incorporates **model versioning**, **CI/CD**, **containerization**, **scheduled inference**, and **retraining workflows**, simulating a real-world production environment.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Hourly Weather Prediction**  
  Predicts temperature and humidity using a LightGBM model trained on historical hourly weather data.

- **Daily Scheduled Inference (Azure)**  
  Automatically fetches past 24 hours of data, performs inference for the next 6 hours, and stores predictions in MongoDB.

- **Model Versioning with MLflow**  
  Models are tracked and stored on Databricks MLflow, supporting easy rollback and version comparison.

- **Containerized Architecture with Docker**  
  All components (training, inference, retraining, app) are containerized for reproducibility and deployment.

- **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**  
  Automated testing and container deployment to Azure Container Apps.

- **Data Drift Detection & Monthly Retraining**  
  Live data is continuously monitored; models are retrained monthly with newly collected data to adapt to changing patterns.

- **Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana**  
  Tracks inference latency, API health, and model performance (planned setup).
